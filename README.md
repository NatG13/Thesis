# Master's Thesis - Data Analysis Code

This repository contains the code used in the Master's thesis of **Natalia Giotopoulou**. The code is organized into two Jupyter notebooks, each handling a different part of the data processing and analysis pipeline.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. `preprocess.ipynb`
This notebook focuses on data preprocessing and cleaning. It includes:
- Loading and inspecting the raw data
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Descriptive statistics and visualizations
- Preparing the dataset for further analysis

### 2. `main.ipynb`
This notebook contains the core analysis for the thesis, including:
- Application of clustering techniques
- Visualization of findings
- Any other statistical analyses relevant to the thesis

## Usage
To run these notebooks:
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed (`pip install notebook`)
2. Clone this repository (`git clone`)
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook (`jupyter notebook`)
4. Open and run the notebooks in order:
   - First run `preprocess.ipynb`
   - Then run `main_analysis.ipynb`

## Dependencies
The code requires the following Python packages:
- Python 3.11
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
